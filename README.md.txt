Introduction

The project is entitled the Exam and at the start was very open. The project description was to build an Android Application for the trainee of Enecosystems pvt ltd. through which they can give exam after their training. Each member of the team was given specific tasks which eventually would join together to make a working Application. One of the advantages of this group approach is that a meaningful project can be attempted, with in less time.

1.1 Objective of Project
The main aim of the project is to check that how clearly the candidates have understood during the training phase. The Candidate/User can give the exam using our application i.e. by choosing the product on which he/she has been trained from multiple products. 

1. To build an attractive and easy to use android application for conducting exam of the trainee/candidate. 
2. To make the Application user friendly by making it light and fast by using JSON and Volley API and PHP for backend.
3. To make the Application mobile friendly by making it the GUI simple and understandable for the user. The Application is designed using very basic color contrast and the interface has also been made as user friendly as possible for a clear understanding of all the functionalities of the application.
4. To make an application for conducting exams of the trainee online so that candidate can take test from anywhere possible. 





1.2 Present System Description
The android application presently is in full working stage. The candidates can register themselves and choose the product of which they want to take test of and fill up the key of the product. After this process the candidate get redirected to the instruction pop up, where the candidate chooses to continue or decline the test.
After continuing the candidate will come across various questions related to the product. Each question will appear on the screen for about 60 seconds the candidate then can answer the questions .Each question have marks after the test is submitted the result gets calculated and the organization member decides whether they passed the test or not.
The user when registers there data gets stored in the database. Where there automatic unique id also gets generated. When the user selects a product the questions of that product are fetched from the database and simultaneously the answers are matched and score count is tracked.
When the user completes their test the marks are updated in the database. This application also consists of admin panel where the admin can view the result of the candidates. Admin also has the advantage of managing the products and questions. A simple and useful interface has been developed for the admin using which the admin can update, delete and add the products or questions as per the requirement.
The candidate can download the Application from a link and then have to register themselves using the Gmail account with has been integrated in our application via Google plus API. 
The Application is designed using very basic color contrast and the interface has also been made as user friendly as possible for a clear understanding of all the functionalities of the application.
The Application uses two API’s which are volley API for the database and the Google plus API.



1.3 Problem definition of the Proposed System
The candidates/trainee of the organization had to undergo an examination to get certified for training .The process of conducting test was on paper .Some candidates were not present when the test were conducted which soon became an issue for the organization.
Also, it was hard for the organization to keep track of the result details of the candidates. Which lead to the need of developing software through which candidates can give test form anywhere.

With the growing speed of technological advancement, Smart phones have become the essential components of our daily performance. As we look for convenience, we also respect the devices, which can combine multiple features and which give us more mobility and entertainment. As the whole world is going into the new phase of technological performance, our needs become more sophisticated. On the one hand, we need speed, quality, and effectiveness on the other hand, these features should be combined in a solution small enough to carry it in the pocket.

Smart phones have come to exemplify one of the wisest and the most convenient technological ideas in the history of mankind. The unique combination of features makes Smart phones extremely usable and useful for different purposes. In business or in pleasure Smart phones expand our capabilities and help us resolve our problems in timely manner.

Therefore, Exam android application was developed for smart phones so that the candidates can start there exam from anywhere after the completion of their training.
